# Mission-to-Mars

For this web scraping project, a web app is created using Flask that scrapes data about Mars from public locations. Updated Mars news, facts, and images are presented through an easy-to-read web app. The web scraping occurs using Splinter and BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML of the original websites to find information such as the latest news titles and content, as well as updated images. Styling for the web app is done using HTML and CSS.
